# To use this script, first run the following from the command line:
# cd examples
# ./build-all-examples.sh > build-results.txt

# Output will be put into a new file at examples/build-results.txt

# NOTE: Some of the builds will fail because the folder structure
# for that example is different. e.g., examples/creating-source-plugins/
# contains multiple Gatsby sites, each in their own folder.
# This script won't catch all those edge cases. It's mainly an attempt
# to handle all the easy cases, while identifying individual failing
# examples that need to be investigated manually.
